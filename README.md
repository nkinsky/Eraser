## Overview
This repository contains all the code required to generate figures for Kinsky, Orlin et al. (2024)

## Setup
 - This code utilizes several functions from https://github.com/nkinsky/FearReinstatement. Clone the `FearReinstatement` repo in the same parent directory as the `Eraser` repo.
 - Install a conda/mamba environment using `mamba env create -f eraser.yml`. You may need to add a few modules manually, e.g. `mamba install -c conda-forge notebook` to use Jupyter Notebook.
